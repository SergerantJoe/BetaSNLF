Back in 2013 the SNLF first appeared on the pre-official version of Otori Shima, yet when Betio was released for some arbitrary reason they were changed. Luckily I managed to get a really old version of the game with DepotDownloader and extracted the original files. 

Now you can play as them anywhere, not just Betio!
